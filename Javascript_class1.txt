JavaScript class
===========================

Summary Hello world

The <script> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.
A single <script> tag can’t have both the src attribute and code inside.

syntax:  
<script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' ); //simple script
  </script>

  external file
  <script src="file1.js"></script> // more complex code reside in separate files.

  file1.js
  alert('Hello, world!');

HTML4 syntax: 
<script type="text/javascript"></script>

=====================================================

Code structure - newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!

One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.
Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.
Nested comments are not supported!

=========================================================

The modern mode, "use strict"

Edge case: There’s no way to cancel use strict.
There is no directive like "no use strict" that reverts the engine to old behavior.
Once we enter strict mode, there’s no going back.
"use strict"; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts.

================================================================

Variables

Variables are used to store this information.  let and const keyword are used.
The var keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable but in a slightly different, “old-school” way.
Declaring twice triggers an error.


Variable naming
The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit.
name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used.
Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended.
let, class, return, and function are reserved.

Constants
Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned.
const myBirthday = '29.07.2024';

Uppercase constants
capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";

Summary
We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

let – is a modern variable declaration.
var – is an old-school variable declaration.
const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what’s inside them.

================================================

Data types
There are eight basic data types in JavaScript.
1.Number ( number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.)
2.BigInt (BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.)
3.String (A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.) Double quotes, Single quote, Backticks
4.Boolean (logical type) (The boolean type has only two values: true and false.)
5. The “null” value (The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.)
6. The “undefined” value (The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null)
7. symbol for unique identifiers.
8. Objects (object for more complex data structures.) ( non-primitive data type)


The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

Edge cases:

typeof Math // "object"  (1)

typeof null // "object"  (2)

typeof alert // "function"  (3)
