	1. Tell me about yourself.

	2. How many years of experience with react.js and node.js? 3-4 years of experience

	3. What is debouncing?   
	   Forcefully stopping all the previous execution and considering the latest requests. Debouncing is not predefined. Ex: Bank ATM money withdrawal and deposit.

	4. What is a pure component?
	//Whenever ever "property value in state" changes then only render() function will execute by Pure Component.
  	//in normal components render function won't dependent(check) the value of "property in state"
	//create the Component
	//take the property(num) in state
	//change the num for every 1 sec (setInterval())
	//pass the num to another component (Temp)

	5. Write code // CREATE REACT COMPONENT, EXTERNAL API CALLING  SETTING RESPONSE TO STATE
	
	const app = ()=>{
	useeffect(()=>{
	
	const [data, setdata] = usestate();
	  const res = featchdata();
	  setdata(res);
	},[])
	
	return <div></div>
	}
	
	6. // CREATE A NODE EXPRESS APP WITH 1 GET CALLING
	
	const exp = require('express);
	const app = express()
	
	app.get('/users' , (req, res) =>{
	  return res.send()
	}
	
	7. What is Slice(), Splice()? 
	Splice()  is used to add or remove the elements from an array.
	let arr = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100];
 
	arr.splice(4,2);
	console.log(arr);    //[10,20,30,40,70,80,90,100]

	Slice() - The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array, as a new array object.  Extract particular elements in array.
	let arr = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100];
	console.log( arr.slice(4,6) );    //[ 50, 60 ]


	8. In redux-saga we have a generator function, explain?
	// Generator Functions
	// it is used to control the flow of execution of code inside the "function call".
	// Generator functions suffix with "*"
	// we will use "yield" keyword to "control the execution".
 
/*
    function *fun_one(){
        yield "ReactJS";
        yield "NodeJS";
        yield "MongoDB";
    };
    let cursor = fun_one();
    console.log( cursor.next() );
    console.log( cursor.next() );
    console.log( cursor.next() );
    console.log( cursor.next() );
*/


	9. What is a component and hook?

    The reusable portion of Complex UI Called a Component.

    As a React Developer, we can reuse Components.

    we can call React Applications Component-Based Applications.

    we have two types of Components.

    1) Stateless Components (Functional Components)

    2) Stateful Components (Class Level Components)

	hooks
	======
	Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are backward-compatible.
	Ex. useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer

	10. Have you created any custom hooks?
	yes created a few custom hooks like getting window size and device type.
	Windows, mobile, and tablet resizing.

	11. Typescript utilities explain?
	Yes I have worked.  We have to give types for all the data sets we are consuming like API responses or props we pass from 1 component to another, arguments passed to a function etc.
	TS is used to make the development bug-free because we will know if a particular data is present in the data sets.
	
	12. Display: Inline-block, display: inline what does it do?
	display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.

	13. What is the use of PUT and POST Methods?
	Axios" module used to make the asynchronous calls.
		GET Request     - fetch all employee information
		POST Request   - add new employee 
		PUT Request     - update employee information
		DELETE Request  - delete the existing employee.

	14. Datatypes in Typescript?
	Datatypes in JS
	undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"
	Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
	Number : typeof instance === "number"
	String : typeof instance === "string"
	BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"
	Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"
	
	15. What is Box model?
	All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
	The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

	16. Have you used Bootstrap or any other framework? Material UI

	17. Coding questions: useState (increment+2)

	18. Coding question: name: const p ={name="john" , greet = this.name()} p.greet()  

	19. What is the use of useReducer()?

	20. what is null and undefined?
	NULL something given by the user, let data=NULL;
	Undefined is the default value of the variable when there is no value. Var data;
