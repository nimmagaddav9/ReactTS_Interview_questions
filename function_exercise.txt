1.Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.

let minutes = prompt("enter minutes", )

function convertMintoSeconds(minutes){
return minutes * 60;
}

alert(convertMintoSeconds(minutes));

2.Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.

let newNo = prompt("enter a Number", );

function incrementNumber(newNo){
newNo++
return newNo;
}

alert(incrementNumber(newNo));

3.Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.


let base = prompt("enter base", );
let height = prompt("enter height", );

function area(base, height){
let calcArea = 0.5 * base * height;
return calcArea;
}
alert(area(base, height));

Examples
triArea(3, 2) ➞ 3

triArea(7, 4) ➞ 14

triArea(10, 10) ➞ 50

3 examples passed.

4.  Create a function that takes the age in years and returns the age in days.

let age = prompt("enter age in years", );
function calcDays(age){
let days = age * 365;
return days;
}
alert(calcDays(age));


Examples
calcAge(65) ➞ 23725

calcAge(0) ➞ 0

calcAge(20) ➞ 7300

all tests passed.

5.Create a function that takes voltage and current and returns the calculated power.


let voltage = prompt("enter voltage", );
let current = prompt("enter current", );
function calPower(voltage, current){
let power = voltage * current;
return power;
}
alert(calPower(voltage, current));

Examples
circuitPower(230, 10) ➞ 2300

circuitPower(110, 3) ➞ 330

circuitPower(480, 20) ➞ 9600

Formula power = voltage * ampere

all tests passed.

6.There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.

let firstNumber = prompt("enter no1", );
let secondNumber = prompt("enter no2", );

function calRemainder(firstNumber, secondNumber){
let reminder = firstNumber % secondNumber;
return reminder;
}

alert(calRemainder(firstNumber, secondNumber));

Examples
remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9

remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0

all tests passed.

7.A student learning JavaScript was trying to make a function. His code should concatenate a passed string name with string "Edabit" and store it in a variable called result. He needs your help to fix this code.

const sName = "Edabit";
let name = prompt("enter your name", );

function getStudentName(name, sName){
let result = name + sName;
return result;
}
alert(getStudentName(name, sName));

Examples
nameString("Mubashir") ➞ "MubashirEdabit"

nameString("Matt") ➞ "MattEdabit"

nameString("javaScript") ➞ "javaScriptEdabit"
Notes
Don't forget to return the result

all tests passed.

8. Given two numbers, return true if the sum of both numbers is less than 100. Otherwise return false.

let firstNo = prompt("enter first number", );
let secondNo = prompt("enter Second Number", );

firstNo = Number(firstNo);
secondNo = Number(secondNo);
function calSum(firstNo, secondNo){
let result = firstNo + secondNo;
if(result < 100){
return true;
} else {
return false;
}
}
alert(calSum(firstNo, secondNo));

Examples
lessThan100(22, 15) ➞ true
// 22 + 15 = 37

lessThan100(83, 34) ➞ false
// 83 + 34 = 117

lessThan100(3, 77) ➞ true

all tests passed.

9. A vehicle needs 10 times the amount of fuel than the distance it travels. However, it must always carry a minimum of 100 fuel before setting off.
Create a function which calculates the amount of fuel it needs, given the distance.



let distance = prompt("enter distance", );
let minFuel = 10 * distance;
distance = Number(distance);
function calculateFuel(distance){
if (minFuel > 100) {
return minFuel;
} else {
return 100;
}
}

alert(calculateFuel(distance, minFuel));


Examples
calculateFuel(15) ➞ 150

calculateFuel(23.5) ➞ 235

calculateFuel(3) ➞ 100
Notes
Distance will be a number greater than zero.
Return 100 if the calculated fuel turns out to be less than 100.

all tests passed.

10.  Emmy has written a function that returns a greeting to users. However, she's in love with Mubashir, and would like to greet him slightly differently. She added a special case in her function, but she made a mistake.
Can you help her?
